Some basic SCSS and css files for simple designs I wil lprobably use in the future

sass framework.scss style.min.css --style compressed (to compile it minified css)

sass framework.scss style.css (to compile normal css)

There are also some other files, which allow colors and styles to be hooked in easily. Horray!
